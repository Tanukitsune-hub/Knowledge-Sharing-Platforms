# Structured Execution Handoff

Use this template when work will be performed in a separate Codex run, worktree, machine, or agent context and the execution contract should remain durable.

WORK_ID: `<zero-padded 4-digit ID or Not assigned>`

The orchestrator assigns the Work ID. Do not infer, invent, or renumber one from incomplete repository history. When the repository uses durable Work-ID records, use:

- instruction: `docs/handoffs/<WORK-ID>-instruction.md`
- completion report: `docs/handoffs/<WORK-ID>-report.md`

Delete fields that genuinely do not apply. Keep the handoff focused on outcome and constraints rather than prescribing every implementation step.

## Outcome

Describe the usable end state that must exist.

## Already-Decided Design Choices

List decisions that should not be reopened without new material evidence.

## Source of Truth

Identify authoritative repository paths, documents, schemas, branches, issues, or external sources explicitly designated by the user.

## Required Scope

State the work that must be completed.

## Non-Goals

State material adjacent work that must not be included.

## Acceptance Criteria

Use observable, testable, or inspectable conditions.

## Required Validation Evidence

List the checks, runtime evidence, generated artifacts, screenshots, reports, or comparisons needed before completion.

## Write Boundaries

Identify allowed, restricted, generated, or out-of-scope paths when relevant.

## Delivery

State branch, commit, pull-request, artifact, or reporting expectations.

## Escalation Conditions

Escalate only when a missing decision, safety or integrity risk, architectural contradiction, unsupported external contract, or validation failure prevents safe completion.

## Completion Report

Report:

- completed outcome;
- material files or components changed;
- validation actually executed and observed;
- blockers and non-blocking residual issues;
- material limitations on confidence.
